# Transaction Management System

## Overview

This project is designed to efficiently manage and add new transactions into a blockchain system. The system ensures optimal utilization of mined blocks by managing how new transactions are added.

## How It Works

Every new transaction will be added to the first available empty block. If all current blocks are full, the transaction will be added to the list of current transactions and will be included in the next block to be mined. This mechanism ensures that no mined blocks go to waste and that transactions are managed efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Transaction Management**: Transactions are added to the first available block, ensuring that every mined block is utilized to its fullest capacity.
- **Future Block Allocation**: If all blocks are full, new transactions are queued and added to the next block that gets mined.
- **Resource Optimization**: By ensuring that no mined block is left empty, the system optimizes the use of resources.

## Benefits

- **Prevents Wastage**: Ensures that no mined block is wasted, optimizing blockchain resource usage.
- **Streamlined Process**: Simplifies the process of adding transactions, making the system efficient and reliable.
- **Future-Proof**: The system is designed to handle an increasing number of transactions by efficiently managing block space.

## How to Use

1. **Add Transactions**: Simply add new transactions to the system. The system will handle the rest, ensuring they are added to the appropriate block.
2. **Monitor Blocks**: Keep track of the block utilization to ensure optimal performance.

## Additional Information

This system is ideal for blockchain applications that require efficient and effective management of transactions, ensuring that no resources are wasted and that every transaction is processed in a timely manner.
